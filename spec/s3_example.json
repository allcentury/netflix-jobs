The Studio Innovation product team is front and center of this growth. We build software that fuels the production and creation of Netflix content.

Netflix is on a path to release six animation feature films per year, which no major studio has ever done, on top of the very healthy slate of animation series.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>At Netflix, our animation product team is small so you have the opportunity to make a big impact, and our <a href=\"https://jobs.netflix.com/culture\" class=\"postings-link\">unique culture</a> drives our approach to innovation. We’re seeking ambitious, analytical, and strategic leaders to join our team. You will hire the best engineering talent and will lead a team of engineers to identify new ways to create products that drive impact in Animation. You will collaborate with product, design, and data science leaders to set a vision and chart a course ahead. A successful candidate will have the creativity to look at problems in new ways and the willingness to try new things, a hypothesis-driven mentality, a balance of creativity and analytic skills, and exceptional organizational leadership. The Animation team is growing at a rapid pace and needs a self-starter leader who has experience in strict prioritization and leveraging data to inform their decisions.</div><div><h2>As UI engineering manager at Netflix, a typical day might include the following:</h2><ul><li>Having a 1-1 with an engineer on your team.&nbsp; Building your relationship by getting to know them better, shining a spotlight on their clear communication with a partner, coaching them through a conflict and diving deeper into unlocking new ideas to accelerate developer productivity.</li><li>Preparing a discussion for your team meeting on topics ranging from empathy to execution.</li><li>Recruiting. Identifying and reaching out to UI engineering candidates who might strengthen your team by bringing a diverse perspective your team is currently lacking.

The Studio Innovation product team is front and center of this growth. We build software that fuels the production and creation of Netflix content.

Netflix is on a path to release six animation feature films per year, which no major studio has ever done, on top of the very healthy slate of animation series.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>At Netflix, our animation product team is small so you have the opportunity to make a big impact, and our <a href=\"https://jobs.netflix.com/culture\" class=\"postings-link\">unique culture</a> drives our approach to innovation. We’re seeking ambitious, analytical, and strategic leaders to join our team. You will hire the best engineering talent and will lead a team of engineers to identify new ways to create products that drive impact in Animation. You will collaborate with product, design, and data science leaders to set a vision and chart a course ahead. A successful candidate will have the creativity to look at problems in new ways and the willingness to try new things, a hypothesis-driven mentality, a balance of creativity and analytic skills, and exceptional organizational leadership. The Animation team is growing at a rapid pace and needs a self-starter leader who has experience in strict prioritization and leveraging data to inform their decisions.</div><div><h2>As UI engineering manager at Netflix, a typical day might include the following:</h2><ul><li>Having a 1-1 with an engineer on your team.&nbsp; Building your relationship by getting to know them better, shining a spotlight on their clear communication with a partner, coaching them through a conflict and diving deeper into unlocking new ideas to accelerate developer productivity.</li><li>Preparing a discussion for your team meeting on topics ranging from empathy to execution.</li><li>Recruiting. Identifying and reaching out to UI engineering candidates who might strengthen your team by bringing a diverse perspective your team is currently lacking.
